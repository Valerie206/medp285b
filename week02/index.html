		<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
			<p>
				I aspire to write <em>fictional narratives</em> that provide readers with a temporary escape while exploring topics such as morality and ethics, which influence an individual's sense of self and the meaning they derive from the world around them. I grew up <em>consuming</em> many forms of media, from films to television and even books, specifically anything involving fantasy, romance, or mystery. Many of the recurring themes and tropes found in these genres serve as <i>inspiration</i> for my stories as I am <mark>interested</mark> in reimaging classic story narratives and exploring how slight changes to common story tropes can change characters' actions and beliefs. Understanding why characters behave the way they do offers insights into our own behaviors and can serve as the starting point for reflecting on who we are as individuals.
