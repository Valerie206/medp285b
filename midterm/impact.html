 		<h2>The Cost of Our Digital Lives</h2>
 		<p>Although intangible on the surface, our digital interactions rely on an energy-demanding infrastructure that significantly impacts the planet. Examining the overlooked environmental effects of the Internet sector can encourage the development of online and offline sustainable practices to create a greener future. Although changes to the infrastructure would go a long way in helping the environment, we must also do our part by reimaging our relationship with the internet to reduce our own e-waste.  </p>

      <h3>Reducing Your Digital Footprint</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Emails</h4>
        <p>A single email can generate 0.3g to 50g of CO2. The more content in the email, the greater the amount of CO2 generated. A typical business user creates 298lbs of CO2e every year by simply sending emails, which is equal to driving 200 miles. To reduce these emissions, one can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stop sending unnecessary emails like "thank you" emails</li>
          <li>Swapping email attachments for links to documents</li>
          <li>Not sending messages to multiple recipients</li>
          <li>Unsubscribing from unnecessary mailing lists</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Search Engines</h4>
        <p>Search engines such as Google and Bing have worked to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations by switching to renewable energy and carbon offsetting. Microsoft has even gone as far as to promise to become carbon-negative by 2030. While it's unclear how successful these efforts have been in reducing the 0.2g of CO2e a single search generates, newer options like Ecosia are emerging under the guise of being greener options. 
          <ul>
            <li>Ecosia is a search engine company that claims it will plant a tree for every 45 searches it performs, which can help remove carbon from the atmosphere.</li>
          </ul>
           This is only one of many new eco-friendly search engines emerging.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>YouTube Videos</h4>
        <p>YouTube and clips on social media account for a third of video streaming traffic, which generates as much carbon dioxide as Belgium in a year. However, small changes in your viewing habits could lower your carbon footprint:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stop videos from playing unintentionally when you are not watching by turning off autoplay</li>
          <li>Reduce your use of YouTube as background noise</li>
          <li>Switch from high definition to a lower resolution</li>
          <li>Watch videos over wi-fi rather than mobile network</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Old Files</h4>
        <p>Old and unused files that are stored online take up space on servers, which require a constant stream of electricity to store, back up, and maintain accessibility to data, including old files. As a result, it's essential to consider what files we keep. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Review and clean your files regularly</li>
          <li>Reduce the file size of documents, images, and videos</li>
          <li>Consider what files you choose to download or upload</li>
        </ul>
