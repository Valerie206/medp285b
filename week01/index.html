	<h3>Biography</h3>
	<p>
		My name is Valerie Olivieri-Acosta. I am a student at Hunter College majoring in media studies. I have minimal experience with web design or coding. However, I have a basic understanding of these skills, as I had to build a basic <a href="https://iridescent-resisted-lizard.glitch.me/" target="_blank">website</a> for a previous class and design a basic <a href="https://spicy-oil-turret.glitch.me/" target="_blank">interactive game</a>. I plan to further develop my coding and web design skills by taking a web design class to learn how to create more complex websites. I am considering working in marketing, so understanding web design basics is a valuable skill to have. In my free time, I enjoy baking, reading fantasy books, and watching TV shows and films.

	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>
		I aspire to write fictional narratives that provide readers with a temporary escape while exploring topics such as morality and ethics, which influence an individual's sense of self and the meaning they derive from the world around them. I grew up consuming many forms of media, from films to television and even books, specifically anything involving fantasy, romance, or mystery. Many of the recurring themes and tropes found in these genres serve as inspiration for my stories as I am interested in reimaging classic story narratives and exploring how slight changes to common story tropes can change characters' actions and beliefs. Understanding why characters behave the way they do offers insights into our own behaviors and can serve as the starting point for reflecting on who we are as individuals.
